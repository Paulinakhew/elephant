# elephant

**elephant** is a budget monitoring app built from Python with Flask that uses the [TD Da Vinci api](https://td-davinci.com) for sample data of a customer's spending and earning history and [XenonLab's currency exchange api](https://github.com/XenonLab/xecd-rates-client-python) for currency conversions.  **elephant** also has compatibility with Amazon Alexa and Google Home through the use of [Voiceflow](https://www.voiceflow.com).
